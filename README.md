# General ArchLinux PKGBUILDs

This repo contains some ArchLinux PKGBUILDs that I maintain, and some I don't.
The main purpose of these PKGBUILDs is to keep ArchBioLinux
(https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ronny/archbio.html) more or less up-to-date

The repo contains a bash script, make_packages.sh, to generate binary packages for x86_64 and i686
